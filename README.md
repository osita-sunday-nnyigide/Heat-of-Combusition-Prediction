This repo contains 4,516 SDF files, one csv file containing heat of combustion and PubChem ID of molecules and 

4 python scripts used to implement NNConv, CGN, XGBoost and MLP models

## PRAS usage

To run the python implementation of the models:

1. Ensure that all the imported libraries are installed
   
3. For each model, Change the label_path = r"C:\Users\OS\Desktop\Combustion heat\heat_of_combution.csv" and
   
sdf_dir = r"C:\Users\OS\Desktop\Combustion heat" accordingly (i.e,. relative to where the files are in your PC) 

6. Then, run the python code
